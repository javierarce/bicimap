# Bicimap

üåç Unofficial map of BiciMAD & Bicing stations. 

This project is my attempt to make a friendlier version of the current [BiciMAD](https://u.bicimad.com/mapa) and [Bicing](https://bicing.barcelona/mapa-de-disponibilitat) bike-sharing maps. Visit the map [here](https://bicimap.javierarce.com)
