# BiciMap

üåç Unofficial map of BiciMad stations. 

This is my attempt to make a more useful and nicer version of the [current BiciMad map](https://u.bicimad.com/mapa).

**This project is still in development.**

### TODO

- [ ] Show nearby stations to a given station
- [ ] Improve tooltips (style and content)
- [ ] Remove "Map with Me" legacy code
- [ ] Save last position in the map
- [ ] Add about page
- [ ] Launch project
